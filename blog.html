                    <h2>Why DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Is Important?</h2>
                    <p>
                        DSA builds the foundation of problem-solving. It helps you think logically and write 
                        efficient code. Whether you prepare for placements, crack coding interviews, or build 
                        real-world applications, DSA improves your approach to solving complex problems.
                        <br><br>
                        Companies test DSA because they want engineers who can think, not just code.  
                        Good knowledge of DSA means you can optimize memory, reduce time complexity, and write 
                        scalable programs — which every company needs.

                    <h2>Why Web Development Is a Great Career Choice?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Web Development is one of the most in-demand tech fields. Every business, startup, hospital, 
                        school, and government service now needs a website or web application.  
                        <br><br>
                        If you know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React — you can build anything from 
                        portfolio websites to complete platforms. It offers creativity, long-term career growth, 
                        remote jobs, and high-salary opportunities.

                    <h2>How AI Is Changing the Software Industry</h2>
                    <p>
                        AI is transforming how developers write code. Tools like ChatGPT help in debugging, learning, 
                        writing logic, and building projects faster.  
                        <br><br>
                        But AI will not replace developers — instead, it will empower them.  
                        Developers who understand AI, automation, and machine learning tools will have a huge 
                        advantage.  
                        <br><br>
                        The future belongs to developers who combine logical thinking (DSA) + coding skills + AI tools.
